# Breast Cancer Prediction App

This project is a machine learning application that predicts breast cancer diagnoses based on clinical features. The app leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and provides a user-friendly **Streamlit** web interface for data analysis, model training, and making predictions.

## Features

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explore dataset statistics, class distributions, and feature correlations.
   - Visualize data using interactive charts and heatmaps.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train an ANN model with customizable hyperparameters (hidden layers, activation functions, solvers).
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy, classification performance, and confusion matrix.
   - Save the trained model and scaler for later use.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Enter feature values to make predictions using the trained model.
   - View the predicted outcome and associated probabilities.
